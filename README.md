### Made by Lizeth Valdovinos Rodriguez and Megan Kang

This game was specifically created for the 327 Semester Project to demonstrate the uses of distributed computing in multiplayer gaming.

Unfortunately, the full multiplayer features of this game cannot be used in browser playing mode. However, the view for this game is available [here](https://lizethevald.itch.io/327-semester).
